# Hackathon_sentiment_analysis

Dataset Description:

Train.csv: The training dataset with text and corresponding labels.
Test.csv: The dataset for which you will generate predictions.
Submission.csv: The format for submitting your predictions.

Approach techniques Challenge:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data by handling missing values, removing noise, and normalizing text (e.g., lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization).
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), TF-IDF vectors, and n-grams.
Modeling Techniques: Experiment with models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and advanced models like BERT, RoBERTa, or other transformer-based architectures.
Validation and Tuning: Use techniques such as k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
